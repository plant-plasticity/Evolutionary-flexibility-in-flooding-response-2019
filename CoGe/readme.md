## Data from Reynoso, Kajala, Bajic, West, Pauluzzi et al., (2019) 
Evolutionary flexibility in flooding response circuitry in angiosperms. [Science](https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.aax8862)

Normalized read coverage tracks are available on Cyverse and CoGe for root tip data for each species for:

- ATAC Control (CON) 
- ATAC Submergence (SUB)
- Nuclear RNA CON
- Nuclear RNA SUB
- Total polyA RNA CON
- Total polyA RNA SUB
- TRAP polyA RNA CON
- TRAP polyA RNA SUB
- Ribo-seq RNA CON
- Ribo-seq RNA SUB

To visualize coverage tracks log into CoGe with your Cyverse account. If new to Cyverse, register for free: https://user.cyverse.org/register. Once your account for Cyverse is set up, login to genomevolution.org/coge: https://auth.iplantcollaborative.org/cas4/login?service=https://genomevolution.org/coge/.  Inside this site you can search on the top panel ÒMulti-omic Multi-species Root TipÓ or Òaax8862Ó to find the group of datasets included in the paper.  Enter a notebook for the species of interest and select ÒBrowseÓ. This will open a jBrowse instance with all the samples in the same track. To view samples on individual tracks, expand the panel on the right and select the samples of interest. To visualize a track with gene models select ÒFeatures: allÓ. Use the expandable menu on each loaded sample to adjust the scale of visualization with ÒSet track rangeÓ. Other options are available in the same menu.
